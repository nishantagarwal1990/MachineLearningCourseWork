The folder is divided into subfolders. 

1>The src folder contains the source files for Perceptron code. 

2> The Nishant-HW2.pdf contains solutions as well as report for the programming assignments.

3> The data provided for assignment is in the Data0 and Data1 folder.

4> ML - HW2.xlsx is an excel with all graphs and data for verification if needed.

Steps to execute:

1> Open a terminal and enter the directory where the folder is unzipped.

2> Run ./run.sh on the terminal to compile the code.

3> Run ./perceptron.out

Note: the executable does not take parameters so the data folder has to be in the same folder as executable.


Perceptron:

1> The executable has taken the paths as hardcoded for data0 and data1 files. So the files in the the format given in the folder specific to the name is used. e.g. train0.10 and test0.10

2> For each experiment the output is generated in files.

Experiment 1 : output1.txt
Experiment 2 : output2.txt
Experiment 3 : output3.txt
Experiment 4 : output4.txt
