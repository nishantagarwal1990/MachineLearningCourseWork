\section*{Note}
Do not just put down an answer. We want an explanation. No points will
be given for just a statement of the results of a proof. You will be
graded on your reasoning, not just on your final result. 

Please follow good proof technique; what this means is if you make
assumptions, state them. If what you do between one step and the next
is not trivial or obvious, then state how and why you are doing what
you are doing. A good rule of thumb is if you have to ask yourself
whether what you're doing is obvious, then it's probably not obvious.
Try to make the proof clean and easy to follow.
